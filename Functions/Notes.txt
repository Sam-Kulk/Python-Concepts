Function means a block of code, which will run only when it is called.

There are two types of functions in Python
1. Built-In
2. User Defined

1. Built-In functions will be readily avaliable for use i.e. len(), type() etc..

2. I can work with User-defined function by following two steps
a. Function Defination
b. Calling/Invoking the defined function
