Usually a normal variable will store a single value in it, whenever i want to store
multiple values in a single variable i need to use collections variables concept

Types of collection variables in Python
1. List - []
2. Tuple - ()
3. Set - {}
4. Dictionary - {Key:Value}

1. List is ordered, indexed & mutable
2. Tuple is ordered, indexed & immutable
3. Set is unordered & unindexed, so i cannot access a specific value from the set & also set is mutable

4. Dictionary:
 It stores data in Key:Value format
 Here Key should be unique for every data(If not done the first value will be overriden by the next one), whereas the value can be repeated.
 It will accept all kinds of data
 It is ordered(For python 3.7 & later versions)
 The index concept is not used here, the 'Key' will be used instead of index, so it is unindexed
 It is mutable

When to use which collection
1. If i want to store the items in an order & in-future i may have to change the items, then i need to go for List
2. If i want to store the items in an order & in-future i may not have to change the items, then i need to go for Tuple
3. If i want to store the items & order is not uncessary & in-future i may/may not have to change the items, then i need to go for Set, usually set will not be used much.
4. if i want to store the data in Key:Value pairs, then i need to use the Dictionary
