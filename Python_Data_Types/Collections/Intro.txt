Usually a normal variable will store a single value in it, whenever i want to store
multiple values in a single variable i need to use collections variables concept

The collection variables can have the following four data-types in Python
1. List - []
2. Tuple - ()
3. Set - {}
4. Dictionary - {Key:Value}

Note:
List is indexed, ordered, changeable & allow duplicates
Tuple is indexed, ordered, unchangeable & allow duplicates
Set is unindexed, unordered, unchageable(Only Add & Delete, not Edit) & doesn't allow duplicates
Dictionary is unindexed(uses key), ordered, changeable & doesn't allow duplicates(keys)

The collection should be chosen as per the requirement & according to the collection properties
