If you have Python version 3.4 or later, PIP is included by default in the below path
C:\Users\samarth.kulkarni\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts

Most useful pip commands
-----------------------------
pip install <package-name>
pip install --upgrade <package-name>
pip uninstall <package-name>
pip list
pip --version
Note: I can execute all these commands from any path in cmd, as Scripts path will be present in the System Variable 'Path'.

To upgrade pip, I need to be below path:
C:\Users\samarth.kulkarni\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311

Then I can use the below command:
python -m pip install --upgrade pi, where m stands for module


The packages installed from the pip will be downloaded in the below path:
C:\Users\samarth.kulkarni\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages
