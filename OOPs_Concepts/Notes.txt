Python is both Structured & Object-Oriented programming language, whereas Java is purely an Object-Oriented programming language
It means python does not need class & object to run any program as it Structured

Object Oriented Programming concepts(OOPs concepts)
1. Class
2. Object
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

1. Class:
It is collection of variables & methods
It is just a blue-print

Note: Function vs Method
Function defined inside the class is called Method, if it is defined outside/without the class, then it is general function

2. Object
It is an instance of the class

CLASS VARAIBLES:
The variable which is declared within the class but outside the method, it is called class variable
By default the scope of the class variable is inside the class but outside the method


METHOD V/S CONSTRUCTOR
Method:
I can give any name i.e. def any(self):
It can have parameters
It can return value
To call the method, i need use object i.e.object.any()

Constructor:
Constructor name is fixed i.e. def __init__(self):
It can have parameters
It will not return values
Constructor will be called at the time of object creation
