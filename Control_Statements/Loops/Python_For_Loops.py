# loop through the list
# for x in list1:
#     print(x)

# loop through the string
# for x in string1:
#     print(x)

# range()
# for x in range(6):
#     print(x)

# Note : If I need to loop through x times, use range(x)

# for x in range(2,6):
#     print(x)

# for x in range(3,10,3):
#     print(x)

# break statement is used to exit the loop at a particular iteration or when a specified condition is achieved
# for x in list1:
#     print(x)
#     if x == 3:
#         break

# for x in list1:
#     if x == 3:
#         break
#     print(x)

# continue statement is basically used to skip a particular iteration or stop a particular iteration & coutinue with the next iterartion
# continue should be used before the actions statements are executed

# for x in list1:
#     if x == 3:
#         continue
#     print(x)

# Note: Both the break & continue statements should be used with if statement

# pass statement
for x in list1:
    pass
