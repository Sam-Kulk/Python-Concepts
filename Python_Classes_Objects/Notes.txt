Python is Object-Oriented programming language
Python is even Structured language

Object-Oriented Programming concepts(OOPs concepts)
1. Class
2. Object
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

1. Class:
It is collection of variables/properties & methods/behaviour.
Cars & it's properties & behaviour analogy
It is just an object constructor or a blue-print to create an Object
Class Names should be PascalCase i.e. UpperCamelCase by standard

Note: Function vs Method
Function defined inside the class is called Method, if it is defined outside/without the class, then it is general function

2. Object
It is an instance of the class

Note
--------
1.To access the variables & methods in the class, I should use Object.Variable , Object.Method()
If method is returning anything then I can use directly print(Object.Method()), else use the other way

2. Single class can have multiple objects, but usually it is preffered to use a single object unless it is necessary

Class variables
------------------
1. The variable which is declared within the class but outside the method, it is called class variable
2. By-default the scope of the class variable is inside the class but outside the method

METHOD V/S CONSTRUCTOR
Method:
I can give any name i.e. def any(self):
It can have parameters
It can return value
To call the method, i need use object i.e.object.any()

Constructor:
Constructor name is fixed i.e. def __init__(self):
It can have parameters
It will not return values
Constructor will be called at the time of object creation
