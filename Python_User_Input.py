# input()
# The input function is used to take input from user at run-time

# Example 1
# first_name = input("First Name : ")
# print("The first name is :",first_name)

# Note: # There is no mandatory to specify the string or anything within the input(), it is provided for user understanding

# The input value/data provided by the user is considered as str
# Example 2
num1 = int(input("First Number : "))  # str to int coversion ie. data type conversion
num2 = int(input("Second Number : "))
print(num1 ** num2)
