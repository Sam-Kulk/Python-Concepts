In Python, Package is nothing but collection of modules i.e. it is just like directory

The modules in one package/sub-package can be imported into another package/sub-package by import statement

syntax to import
---------------------
import package.sub-package.moduleName
or
from package.sub-package.moduleName import *(Preffered)

Note:
- By default the control will be in project name
- '.' is used for navigation
